# RAID
## RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks)
- **Use multiple disks** in concert to build a **faster**, **bigger**, and more **reliable** disk system
    - RAID just looks like <u>a big disk</u> to the host system
- Advantage
    - **Performance & Capacity**: Using multiple disks in parallel
    - **Reliability**: RAID can tolerate the loss of a disk

> RAIDs provide these advantages **transparently** to systems that use them

## RAID Interface
- When a RAID receives I/O request,
    1. The RAID **calculates** which disk to access
    2. The RAID **issues** one or more **physical I/Os** to do so
- RAID example: A mirrored RAID system
    - Keep <u>two copies</u> of each block (each one on a separate disk)
    - Perform <u>two physical I/Os</u> for every one logical I/O it is issued
